## Contents
The idea behind the talk was to explain the ideology behind Exploratory Data Analysis and why it is essential for any Data Science project.

- The *slides* can be viewed at http://bit.ly/SuriEDAPyData.

- The *proposal* can be viewed at https://github.com/pydatadelhi/talks/issues/68.

The talk included a lot of content from the following projects:

1. [Investigating Factors Affecting Wine Quality](): This project investigates a dataset using EDA to find chemical properties that affect red wine quality.

2. [Identifying Fraud from Enron Email Dataset](): This project includes a section which uses EDA to remove outliers.

## Message
The meet-up was a great experience as I got meet some amazing people. I certainly look forward to collaborating on a new project. One of the ideas I have is to explore datasets on different beverages (such as [white wine](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality)) or maybe some food items.
